# Arthur-the-Joker-Chat-bot
I always found chatbot applications fascinating, knowing that you can talk to and interact with machines like a friend. This inspired me to experiment with technologies used in chatbots, such as machine learning and natural language processing. 
The project is an interactive Chatbot application that tells jokes and comedic stories with the aim of promoting laughter. Implemented through Python programming language and makes use of the NumPy, TensorFlow, Neural Networking and Natural Language Processing libraries. Created with around 140 lines of code.
